# Face Recognition
This project focuses on building a robust and accurate face recognition system. The system can detect and identify faces in images and videos, making it suitable for various applications such as security, access control, and user authentication.

- **Face Detection** : Utilizes a combination of Haar cascades and deep learning models to accurately detect faces in images and videos.

## Face Detection
Face detection is a fundamental computer vision task that involves locating and identifying faces within an image. Traditionally, methods like Haar cascades have been used for face detection, but with the advent of deep learning, models like EfficientDet have gained popularity for achieving higher accuracy.
